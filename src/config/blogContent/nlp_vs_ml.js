const p1 = `Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning 
    (ML) are two commonly used terms in the field of Artificial 
    Intelligence (AI). While they are related, they are not the same 
    thing. In this blog post, we will explore the difference between 
    NLP and ML and how they are used in practice.`

const p2 = `NLP is a subfield of AI that focuses on the interaction 
    between humans and computers using natural language. The goal of 
    NLP is to develop algorithms and models that can analyze, 
    understand, and generate human language. NLP can be used for a 
    wide range of applications, from chatbots and virtual assistants 
    to sentiment analysis and machine translation.`
    
const p3 = `On the other hand, ML is a broader concept that involves 
    developing algorithms and models that can learn from data and make 
    predictions or decisions based on that data. ML algorithms can be 
    used for a wide range of applications, not just in language 
    processing, but in many other areas as well, including image 
    recognition, recommendation systems, and fraud detection.`
    
const p4 = `While NLP and ML are related, they differ in their focus 
    and application. NLP is specifically concerned with language 
    processing and enabling computers to understand and generate human 
    language, while ML is concerned with learning from data and making 
    predictions or decisions based on that data.`

const p5 = `In practice, both NLP and ML can be used together to 
    create powerful language processing systems. For example, a 
    chatbot could use ML algorithms to understand the intent of a 
    user's message and then use NLP techniques to generate a natural 
    language response. Similarly, a sentiment analysis system could 
    use ML to classify text as positive, negative, or neutral, and 
    then use NLP to extract key phrases and concepts from the text.`
